3. What day is the fourteenth of a given month?

I. The last day of the month is a Wednesday.

II. The third Saturday of the month was seventeenth.


(a) if the data in statement I alone are sufficient to answer the question;

(b) if the data in statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question;

(c) if the data either in I or II alone are sufficient to answer the question;

(d) if the data even in both the statements together are not sufficient to answer the question;

(e) if the data in both the statements together are needed;

Solution:
(b) is the correct answer.
(I): Knowing that the 17th is a Saturday means that the 14th is a Wednesday.

(II): Knowing that the month ends on Wednesday isn't enough information.
Months have variable number of days, so this information doesn't help.
